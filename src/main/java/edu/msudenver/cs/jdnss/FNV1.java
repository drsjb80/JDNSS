/**
 * A family of fast hash functions, originally created by Glenn Fowler, Phong Vo,
 * and improved by Landon Curt Noll.
 *
 * <p>FNV1 hashes are designed to be fast while maintaining a low collision rate.
 * The FNV1 speed allows one to quickly hash lots of data while maintaining a
 * reasonable collision rate. The high dispersion of the FNV1 hashes makes them
 * well suited for hashing nearly identical strings such as URLs, hostnames,
 * filenames, text, IP addresses, etc.</p>
 *
 * <p>FNV1a is a variant of FNV1, which is slightly better suited for hashing
 * short values (< 4 octets).</p>
 *
 * <p>This is a straightforward port of the public domain C version,
 * written by Landon Curt Noll (one of the authors), available from
 * <a href="http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/">his website</a>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The usage pattern is as follows: to compute the initial hash value
 * you call one of the <code>init(...)</code> methods. After that you may
 * update the hash zero or more times with additional values using the
 * <code>update(...)</code> methods. When you are done, you can retrieve the
 * final hash value with {@link #getHash()}.</p>
 * <p>Individual instances of FNV1 are reusable after you call one of
 * the <code>init(...)</code> methods. However, these implementations are NOT
 * synchronized, so proper care should be taken when using this hash in a multi-threaded
 * environment.</p>
